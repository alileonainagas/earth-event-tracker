_Ça va!_ The whole purpose of this app is to basically render markers on a map. The current data source of its core comes from the _NASA EONET API_. On the other hand, the mapping tool that I used was _React Leaflet_. However, further implementations are near in order to supply many other events taking place. _À la prochaine!_
